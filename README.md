# npy-format-js
A JavaScript library for robustly and efficiently reading Numpy (*.NPY) format data.

# Goal

Full and complete support for the Numpy data format.

# Why not NPYJS?

The existing npyjs library is quite dense with bugs, as well as implementation decisions which  do not generalize. Considering the relatively small amount of code in that project, I found it easier to start from scratch here.

# Disclaimer

I'm writing this largely as a Javascript learning project, expect no warranty.
